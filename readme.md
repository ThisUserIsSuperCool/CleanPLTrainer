# CleanPLTrainer

I am currently exploring a decent lightning trainer. The aim is to develop a powerful tool to aid my research: writing the least code with maximum flexibility.

Currently I am thinking and sharing about the rules and philosophy of the design. The completed code will be released after I test the system on a completed project first.

## Current Rules
1. There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.
2. Always ensure clear boundaries among modules. Minimize their dependence.
3. Files always stay at correct place. Easy to find them when you need them.
